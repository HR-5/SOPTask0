INTRODUCTION TO GIT:
Git is a Version Control System (VCS). Version Control Systems are a category of software tools that help to manage changes to a code over time. VCS keeps track of every change to the code. 
Basically, using a VCS generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover them. Guess that’s motivation enough to learn Git.

TASK 0
We are faced with the most important question of the century- Which came first: the chicken or the egg? And now, we want your help to resolve this question.
Tell us your answer by following the steps below:
•	Fork and clone the common github repo (link will be provided by your mentor) to your local system.
•	Create a branch named firstname_lastname.
•	In your branch, create a file named log.txt. In this file, you will inventory all the commands you’ve used to complete this task with a short description of each.
•	Also create two branches. In one, give a one word answer to the question posed above. In the other, explain why you decided on that answer.
•	Now merge the two branches. Got conflicts? Resolve them manually. Then run Git merge again
•	When you’re ready, pull the most recent changes from the repo. Then, commit your changes and create a pull request.
•	If everything looks good, your mentor will accept your request. Otherwise, convince them your answer is right!
•	Once your pull request is accepted, fetch and pull the changes to the repo. In your mentor’s branch, push your log.txt file. Remember to rename it name_log.txt.
•	Create another pull request.
